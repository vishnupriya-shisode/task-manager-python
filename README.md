# Task Manager in Python

A simple command-line task manager built with Python using Vim

## Features

- Add tasks
- View tasks
- Delete tasks
- Easy to use commands: `add`, `view`, `delete`, `help`, `quit`

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/vishnupriya-shisode/task-manager-python.git
2. Navigate into the project folder: cd task-manager-python
3. Run the program: python3 task_manager.py
4. Use the commands to manage your tasks.

## Commands

- `add` - Add a new task
- `view` - View all tasks
- `delete` - Delete a task by its number
- `help` - Show available commands
- `quit` - Exit the program

## How it Works

The program stores your tasks in a list and allows you to manage them through a simple text interface. You can add new tasks, view the current list, and delete tasks by specifying their number.

## Future Improvements
